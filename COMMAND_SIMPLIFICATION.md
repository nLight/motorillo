# Command Simplification Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to simplify the command protocol by removing legacy position and home commands without speed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Legacy Commands

**JavaScript (webusb/script.js):**

- Removed `CMD_POS = 2` (legacy position without speed)
- Removed `CMD_HOME = 6` (legacy home without speed)
- Removed `CMD_HOME_WITH_SPEED = 16` (separate home command)
- Kept only `CMD_POS_WITH_SPEED = 15` for all position movements

**Arduino (src/command_processor.cpp):**

- Removed `CMD_POS`, `CMD_HOME`, and `CMD_HOME_WITH_SPEED` from enum
- Removed corresponding case handlers from switch statement
- Kept only `CMD_POS_WITH_SPEED` case for unified position control

### 2. Unified Home Operation

**Before:**

- Home button used `CMD_HOME_WITH_SPEED` with 4-byte speed parameter
- Separate command type for home vs. move operations

**After:**

- Home button uses `CMD_POS_WITH_SPEED` with position=0 and speed
- Same binary format as regular move: `position(2 bytes) + speed(4 bytes)`
- Home is now just "move to position 0" which is conceptually cleaner

### 3. JavaScript Implementation

**handleHome() function:**

```javascript
handleHome() {
  const speed = parseInt(document.getElementById("manualSpeed").value);
  const position = 0; // Home is position 0

  // Use position command with position 0
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(6);
  const view = new DataView(buffer);
  view.setUint16(0, position, true);
  view.setUint32(2, speed, true);

  this.sendCommand(this.CMD_POS_WITH_SPEED, new Uint8Array(buffer));
  this.log(`Going home (position 0) at ${speed}ms per step`);
}
```

### 4. Benefits of Simplification

1. **Fewer Commands**: Reduced from 4 position-related commands to 1
2. **Consistent Protocol**: All movements use same binary format
3. **Simplified Logic**: Home is just "move to position 0"
4. **Code Reduction**: Less command handling code in both JavaScript and Arduino
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Single code path for all position movements

### 5. Files Modified

- `webusb/script.js`: Removed legacy command codes, updated handleHome()
- `src/command_processor.cpp`: Removed legacy command enum values and handlers
- `MANUAL_VELOCITY_CONTROL.md`: Updated documentation to reflect changes

### 6. Protocol Summary

**Current Commands:**

- `CMD_POS_WITH_SPEED (15)`: Move to any position with custom speed
  - Format: `position(2) + speed(4)`
  - Used for both regular moves and home (position=0)

**Removed Commands:**

- `CMD_POS (2)`: Position without speed
- `CMD_HOME (6)`: Home without speed
- `CMD_HOME_WITH_SPEED (16)`: Separate home command

This simplification makes the protocol more consistent and easier to maintain while preserving all functionality.
